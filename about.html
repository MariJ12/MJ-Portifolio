    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <h1>Hi, I am Mariana but call me MJ</h1>
    <p>
      I am from Brazil, I grew up in a big town, country side of Sao Paulo. Life
      there was interessing, it was not easy, as a child I suffered bullying, so
      I grew up stronger then never. I've managed to fight back to the point
      that I wanted to became a popular girl, so no one would beat me for who I
      was but for who I became. I started to change my friends, my clothes, my
      aways...I became a mean girl. And yes I did wear pink on Wednesdays. I
      meet a lot of cool people, had cool jobs when I left school and I meet a
      guy that spoke Portuguese... we got married and I came to England. Until
      this day, back home, people have been asking how did I do it? How did she
      became a mean girl? How did she become so attractive? How did she meet
      such a cool guy? How she bouced back in life?

    <h3>Today</h3>
    <p>
      That same power that empored me to change to become who I wanted, has been
      expressed by learning coding. It started as a Job changing carreer than
      moved to be a hobbie. When you want something... nothing can stop you, you
      fall, you learn, you grow. That is life....<br />
      Today I help woman to get that same self power to do what is needed to be
      done, be happy! Welcome to my 1st Portiffolio.
